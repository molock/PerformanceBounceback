# Performance Bounceback

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

## Author
- Wayne Lee

## Time for the project
- About 6 hours

## Versions
- Unity 2017.2.0f3

## Headset
- Oculus Rift CV1 with Rift touch controller (HTC Vive maybe work as well because I use the SteamVR SDK which has the full support for both Oculus Rift and HTC Vive)

## One thing I like in this project
I found that there is not a method to deactive the balls in ballpool. So I created a class attached to the Ground Gameobject to deactive the ball that collided with it.
